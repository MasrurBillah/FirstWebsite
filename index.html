    <h2>Why write a <span class="color-change">review article?</span></h2>
    <h3 class="review">Here are 8 key things to consider when writing a review article:</h3>
    <p class="review"><strong>1. Check the journal’s aims and scope </strong></p> 

    <p class="review">Make sure you have read the aims and scope for the journal you are submitting to and follow them closely. Different journals accept different types of articles and not all will accept review articles, so it’s important to check this before you start writing.</p> 

    <p class="review"><strong>2. Define your scope</strong></p>   

    <p class="review">Define the scope of your review article and the research question you’ll be answering, making sure your article contributes something new to the field.</p>    

    <p class="review">As award-winning author Angus Crake told us, you’ll also need to “define the scope of your review so that it is manageable, not too large or small; it may be necessary to focus on recent advances if the field is well established.”</p>     

    <p class="review"><strong>3. Finding sources to evaluate</strong> </p>   

    <p class="review">When finding sources to evaluate, Angus Crake says it’s critical that you “use multiple search engines/databases so you don’t miss any important ones.”</p>

    <p class="review">For finding studies for a systematic review in medical sciences, read advice from NCBI.</p>     

    <p class="review"><strong>4. Writing your title, abstract and keywords </strong></p>    

    <p class="review">Spend time writing an effective title, abstract and keywords. This will help maximize the visibility of your article online, ensuring the right readers find your research. Your title and abstract should be clear, concise, accurate, and informative.</p>    

    <p class="review">For more information and guidance on getting these right, read our guide to writing a good abstract and title and our researcher’s guide to search engine optimization.</p>     

    <p class="review"><strong>5. Introduce the topic</strong> </p>    

    <p class="review">Start with an overview of the topic and give some context, explaining why a review of the topic is necessary. Gather research to inform your introduction and make it broad enough to reach out to a large audience of non-specialists. This will help maximize its wider relevance and impact.</p> 

    <p class="review">Don’t make your introduction too long. Divide the review into sections of a suitable length to allow key points to be identified more easily.</p>   

    <p class="review ending"><strong>6. Include critical discussion </strong></p>    

    <p class="review ending">Make sure you present a critical discussion, not just a descriptive summary of the topic. If there is contradictory research in your area of focus, make sure to include an element of debate and present both sides of the argument. You can also use your review paper to resolve conflict between contradictory studies.</p>
